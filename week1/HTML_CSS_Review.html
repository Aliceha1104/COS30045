	<h1>Pets and Pandemic</h1>
	<h2>Phuong Doanh Ha</h2>
	
		<p>A report from Animal Medicines Australia (AMA) has found that many Australians took the opportunity to introduce a pet into their household during the pandemic. Their survey indicated that there was a significant increase in the percent of households taking in a new dog, fish or bird. Their research also indicated that pets had a number of positive influences on their lives such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Companionship</li>
			<li>Better mental health</li>
			<li>Joy and happiness.</li>
		 </ul>
